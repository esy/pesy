# pesy

`pesy` is a command line tool to assist with your native Reason/OCaml
workflow using the package.json itself.

1. Quickly bootstrap a new Reason project
2. Configure your builds

## Installation

` npm install -g pesy`

## Why pesy?
`esy` is driven by a package.json to bring the familiar NPM workflow
to the native world of Reason/OCaml. `pesy` takes this further by
adopting NPM conventions to configure the build.`esy`'s package.json
first approach in creating developer sandboxes brings interesting
possibilities to the table. `pesy` leverages on those features to make
native development both convenient and familiar. 

`pesy` provides 

1. A bootstrapper script to quickly create a project template
2. An alternative JSON syntax around Dune that is NPM like
3. Built in tasks that take full advantages of esy's capabilities

## Getting started
### Creating a new project

`pesy` can quickly bootstrap a basic native Reason/OCaml project.

```sh
cd my-new-project/
pesy
```

### Adding project dependencies

Say, we need `@opam/yojson` and `@reason-native/console` in `App.re`.

Place `App.re` in a folder (say, `bin/`?) and add the following to you
package.json. 

```json
"buildDirs": {
  "bin": {
    "imports": [
	  "Json = require('@opam/yojson')",
	  "Console = require('@reason-native/console/lib')"
	]
  }
}
```
<continueRight/>

Run `esy pesy` (once). Run `esy` after that to create builds.

`pesy` abstracts library identifiers (in this case `yojson` and
`console.lib`) in file paths conceptually. Use native dependencies
from OCaml like you did with NPM!

### Where pesy shines
However, `pesy`'s is truly useful for frameworks that need
a lot dependencies and configuration. Ex: Morph and Revery 

```sh
pesy --template pesy/template-revery --directory my-new-project
```

If you are authoring a framework, create a template like
[`pesy/template-revery`](https://github.com/pesy/template-revery) and
run the project on the CI with a setup that `pesy` creates for you.

You users get cached CI artifacts that will let can hydrate their
local `esy` cache avoid long wait times! See [Templates](#pesy-templates-experimental-creating-your-own-template) to see how
to create such templates.

## Relation to Dune

Pesy as accepts package.json as input and producing dune files as output.

```
                  +--------+
package.json ---> |  pesy  | +--->  dune files
                  +--------+
```

<continueRight/>

Note that not all of Dune's features are supported in pesy (PRs
welcome). `pesy` doesn't intend to duplicate Dune's efforts - it's
meant to compliment it. For simple use cases, `pesy` wants to provide
a NPM friendly interface to Dune so that newcomers can quickly get
started, without confusing themselves with the library vs packages
nuances.

## Namespacing

Every library, as we know, exposes a namespace/module under which it's APIs are
available. However, as package authors, it can hard to make sure one
is not using a namespace already taken by another package (Otherwise
it could lead to collisions). Pesy works around this by assigning the library
the upper camelcase of the root package name and directory the
library/sub-package resides in. 

Example: if a package.json looks like this 

```json
{
  "name": "@myscope/foo",
  "buildDirs": {
    "library": { ... }
  }
}
```

Then, subpackage `library` takes a namespace of
`MyScopeFooLibrary`. As a user, however, you shouldn't have to worry
much about yourself, since you can specify how you'd like to import
subpackages (and packages). In the above example, another subpackage
would consume it as follows

```json
{
  "name": "@myscope/foo",
  "buildDirs": {
    "library": { ... },
    "anotherLibrary": {
      "imports": [
        "ThatOtherLibrary = require('@myscope/foo/library')"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

And if you were consuming this package (after having published to
npm), you can import it as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "bar",
  "buildDirs": {
    "library": {
      "imports": [
        "ThatFooLibrary = require('@myscope/foo/library')"
      ]
    }
  }
```

<continueRight/>

With the new NPM like conventions, pesy automatically handles the
namespace for you so that we don't have to worry about the nuances of
a package and a library during development. 


## Commiting the dune files

While dune files can be thought of as generated artifacts,
we strongly recommended that you always commit them.

> Note: You should always commit the generated dune files before publishing a
> package (Eject them).

In case, you need to re-generate them, run `esy pesy` (or `esy
@mysandbox pesy` if you are using `esy` sandboxes).

#### Ejecting:

It is always possible to eject out of pesy config by running `esy pesy
eject ./subpackage-path`

## CI & local cache Warming up

Compilation artifacts built on the CI can be downloaded by `pesy warmup`.  At
the moment, we only support Azure Pipelines can be configured as follows.

```json
{
  "pesy": {
    "azure-project":
      "<azure-project>/<azure-pipeline-name>",
    "github":
      "<github-org>/<github-repo>"
  }
}
```
<continueRight/>

This will fetch appropriate artifacts compiled for the current
machine. Note however, the best way to get this feature to work is to
use cache publish and restore mechanism provided bootstrapped
files. `pesy` assumes that the artifact zip file names and/or paths
haven't changed.


#### How it works
Compilation artifacts created by `esy` are relocatable - since `esy`
sandboxes isolated, all the dependencies are accounted for and each
dependency is loaded from a path with a fixed-length prefix. Such
artifacts can be built on one machine and used on other provided the
prefixes are rewritten to reflect the updated path on the new
machine. And `esy` provides all the low level command to do this out of
the box. `pesy` simply provides a convenient wrapper that drives them.

## Publishing and Consuming from NPM
#### Publishing libraries

Easiest way to get started with distributing you library is to publish
the source to NPM. 

Let's take a look at an example.

Consider a base package `foo` that you created and distributed on NPM. And let's assume, `bar` is the package that consumes `foo`.

```sh
$ pesy --directory foo-lib
```

This would have bootstrapped a project with the default template with
`Util.re` in the `library/` folder.

Let's publish it

```sh
$ npm publish
```

#### Consuming `foo-lib`

Let quickly create a new project, `bar` and add `foo`.

```sh
$ pesy --directory bar
$ esy add foo-lib
```

We can now require `foo`

```diff
  "buildDirs": {
    "library": {
      "imports": [
+        "FooLib = require('foo-lib/library')"
      ]
    }
  }
```

And then edit Utils.re

```reason
let foo = () => {
  FooLib.Util.foo();
  print_endline("This is from bar");
};
```

```sh
$ esy
$ esy start
Hello from foo!
This is from bar
```

## Templates [experimental]

#### Usage

To use a custom template run `pesy --template=github:your-name/your-pesy-template`
  
#### Creating your own template

*This is a experimental feature that could see a lot of churn. We
request you to watch the issue tracker for updates.*

It works by downloading a git repo and then replacing special strings
in filenames and files inside the repo. The special strings are
currently these: 

###### In file names:

| In filename                      |  Replaced with                |
| -------------------------------- |  ---------------------------- |
| `__PACKAGE_NAME__`               |  `package_name`               |
| `__PACKAGE_NAME_FULL__`          |  `package_name`               |
| `__PACKAGE_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL__`   |  `PackageName`                |


###### In file content:

| In contents                  | Replaced with                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `<PACKAGE_NAME>`             | `package_name`               |
| `<PACKAGE_NAME_FULL>`        | `package_name`               |
| `<PACKAGE_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL>` | `PackageName`                |
| `<VERSION>`                  | `version`                    |
| `<PUBLIC_LIB_NAME>`          | `package_name/library`       |
| `<TEST_LIB_NAME>`            | `package_name/test`          |

Best way to get started creating a new template is to download
https://github.com/esy/pesy-reason-template and work on it. Any
changes can be tested with `pesy test-template`.

## Supported Dune Config
This is reference guide explaining the config `pesy` supports.

### Binaries

Configuration that applies to subpackages that create binary
executables. Note that these executables can be ocaml bytecode or
native binaries (ELF/Mach/PE) 

#### bin : `string`
A subpackage produces binary when it contains a `bin` property. 

```json
{
  "buildDirs": {
    "src": {
      "bin": "Main.re"
    }
  }
}
```

<continueRight/>

Here is a [complete, working example](https://github.com/prometheansacrifice/pesy-samples/blob/master/simple-bin/package.json)

#### modes : `array(string)`
An array of [advanced linking
modes](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dune-files.html?highlight=modules_without_implementation#linking-modes). Each
string should be of the form "`compilation-mode` `binary-kind`" where
`compilation-mode` is one byte, native or best and `binary-kind` is
one of c, exe, object, shared_object. 

```json
{
  "buildDirs": {
    "src": {
	  "bin": "Foo.re",
	  "modes": [ "native", "exe"] 
	}
  }
}
```

<continueRight/>

Here is a [complete, working example](https://github.com/prometheansacrifice/pesy-samples/blob/master/bin-modes/package.json)

#### name (override) : `string`
A string that maps to Dune's `public_name`. Usually unnecessary (as
`bin` property takes care of it) and must only be used to override. 

#### main (override) : `string`
A string that maps to Dune's `name`. Usually unnecessary (as `bin`
property takes care of it) and must only be used to override the entry
point. 

### Libraries

#### modes : `array(string)`

`modes` can be used to configure the compilation target - [native](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/native.html) or
[bytecode](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/comp.html) An
array of string, any of `byte`, `native`, `best` 

##### `"byte"` 
This mode generates byte code output

##### `"native"`
This mode generates native output

##### `"best"`
Sometimes it may not be obvious if native compilation is supported on a
machine. In such circumstances, use `"best"` and `"native"` will be picked for
you if it's available. Else, it'll be `"byte"`

#### cNames : `array(string)`
When writing C stubs to FFI into a library, simply mention the file
name (without the `.c` extension) in the `cNames` field.

```json
{
  "buildDirs": {
    "src": {
      "cNames": ["my-stub1", "my-stub-2"]
	}
  }
}
```

<continueRight/>

Here is a [complete, working example](https://github.com/prometheansacrifice/pesy-samples/blob/master/cNames/package.json)

### Config supported by both libraries and binaries

#### imports : `array(string)`

`imports` can be used to import a library (from a subpackage or an
external npm/opam package) and utilise the namespace of the imported
library.

```json
{
  "buildDirs": {
    "src": {
	  "imports": [
	    "Console = require('console')"
	  ]
	}
  }
}
```

The above config makes a namespace `Console` available inside the
subpackage `src`. Now any `.re` file inside `src` can use the
`console` library.

```reason
// src/SomeFile.re
let foo = () => Console.log("Hello, world")
```

We can also import a package/subpackage under a different namespace

```json
{
  "buildDirs": {
    "src": {
	  "imports": [
	    "NotConsole = require('console')"
	  ]
	}
  }
}
```

And we can import (oddly confusing) `NotConsole` from in `src`

```reason
// src/SomeFile.re
let foo = () => NotConsole.log("Hello, world");
```

We can also import other subpackages in the project.

```json
{
  "buildDirs": {
    "src": {
      "bin": "Main.re",
      "imports": [
        "FooConsole = require('console/lib')",
        "MyOwnLibrary = require('../my-own-lib')"
      ]
    },
    "my-own-lib": {}
  }
}
```

<continueRight/>

Here is a [complete, working example](https://github.com/prometheansacrifice/pesy-samples/blob/master/imports/package.json)

#### Compiler flags
###### All of type *list(string)*

- `flags` - These flags will be passed to both the bytecode compiler and native compiler
- `ocamlcFlags` - These will be passed to `ocamlc` - the bytecode compiler
- `ocamloptFlags` - These will be passed to `ocamlopt` - the native compiler
- `jsooFlags` - These will be passed to `jsoo` compiler - the [javascript compiler](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/3.5.1/manual/overview). *Note: This is unrelated to [Bucklescript](https://bucklescript.github.io/)*



#### Preprocessor flags : `list(string)`

`preprocess` accepts options needed to pass the source files via a
preprocessor first. When using custom syntax not natively supported in
the compiler, we pass the sources in a subpackage via a preprocessor
first.

For example, suppose we'd like to use `let%lwt` syntax for our `Lwt` promises

```reason

let%lwt foo = Lwt.return("foo");
print_endline(foo);

// instead of 
Lwt.return >>=
  (foo => print_endline(foo); Lwt.return())
```

We specify `lwt_ppx` in `pps preprocess`

```json
{
  "buildDirs": {
    "src": {
	  "bin": "Main.re",
	  "preprocess": ["pps", "lwt_ppx"]
	}
  }
}
```

<continueRight/>

Here is a [complete, working example](https://github.com/prometheansacrifice/pesy-samples/blob/master/preprocess/package.json)

#### includeSubdirs : `string = "no"|"unqualified"`

Default is "no", and changing to "unqualified" will compile modules at
deeper directories.

#### Escape hatches for unsupported Dune config

It's always possible that there are features Dune offers are needed and
the options above are not enough. Use `rawBuildConfig` to add
options in a given library or binary. Use `rawBuildConfigFooter` to
add config to the footer.

##### rawBuildConfig : `list(string)`

Example

```json
{
  "src": {
    "rawBuildConfig": [ "(libraries unix)" ],
    "bin": "Main.re"
  }
}
```
##### rawBuildConfigFooter : `list(string)`

Example

```json
{
  "src": {
    "rawBuildConfigFooter": [
      "(install (section share_root) (files (plaintext.txt as asset.txt)))"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Tutorials
  
#### Simple native example
#### CLI Apps
#### Web Development with Morph
  
## Development

Clone the repo and run `esy` on it.

#### e2e tests

`./_build/install/default/bin` would contain (after running `esy`) `Runner.exe`. `Runner.exe` looks for `PESY_CLONE_PATH` variable in the environment to find `pesy` source. Set it to the path where the project was cloned.

To test if simple workflows work as expected. They assume both `esy` and `pesy` are installed
globally (as on user's machines).

## Changelog
**version 0.4.0 (12/21/2018)**

- Allow `buildDirs` to contain deeper directories such as `"path/to/my-lib": {...}"`.
- Added support for `wrapped` property on libraries.
- Added support for `virtualModules` and `implements` - properties for Dune
  virtual libraries. (This will only be supported if you mark your project as
  Dune 1.7 - not yet released).
- Stopped using `ignore_subdirs` in new projects, instead using
  `(dirs (:standard \ _esy))` which only works in Dune `1.6.0+`, so made new
  projects have a lower bound of Dune `1.6.0`.
- Support new properties `rawBuildConfig` which will be inserted at the bottom
  of the _target_ being configured (library/executable).
  - It expects an array of strings, each string being a separate line in the
    generated config.
- Support new properties `rawBuildConfigFooter` which will be inserted at the
  bottom of the entire Dune file for the _target_ being configured.
  - It expects an array of strings, each string being a separate line in the
    generated config.
- Support new properties `modes` for binaries and libraries `list(string)`.
