### Rely 2.1.0
* describeOnly, testOnly
  * if there is a describeOnly or testOnly present anywhere in the set of tests
  to be run, only tests inside of a testOnly or describeOnly will be run. skip
  takes precedence over only (e.g. a testOnly inside a describeSkip will be skipped)
  * this is only intended for use in local development as a single only disables
  every other test
* ciMode
  * the ciMode option has been added to runConfig, when run with ciMode(true) or
  in CLI mode with the --ci flag ci mode will be enabled. Currently this causes
  Rely to throw an exception if there any testOnly or describeOnly. To skip
  tests in CI use testSkip/describeSkip
* expect.option matchers
  * toBeNone, toBeSome, toBe matchers

### Rely 2.0.0
* [**BREAKING**] Add optional locations to Passed and Skipped test status variant constructors for reporters
* [**BREAKING**] TestFramework.extendDescribe now returns a record instead of a describe function

    * needed for future implementation of describeOnly/testOnly

* Improve printing of exceptions with multiple lines of text
