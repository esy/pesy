Thanks to the following libraries for being useful as references/guides for how
to handle various system/terminal integration.

- [bos](https://github.com/dbuenzli/bos) For demonstrating how to correctly and
  robustly handle `Unix` exceptions. It is a great reference for which `Unix`
  exceptions are raised for which operations, and demonstrates the robust
  pattern of reattempts on interupt exceptions.

- `utf` was coppied from IwanKaramazow's
  (unicode.re)[https://github.com/IwanKaramazow/unicode.re].
