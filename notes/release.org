* Release process

  The release process is mostly manual right now and works like this.
  
** @pesy/esy-pesy

   1. =git ls-files | xargs sed -i 's/dev.<num>/alpha.<num/g'=
   2. Commit and push
   3. Tag the commit for just =@pesy/esy-pesy=
   4. =npm publish= (watch the tag)

 
   =@pesy/esy-pesy= is preferably released first so that =pesy-reason-template= can be updated with it

  
** Update pesy-reason-template with the newly released @pesy/esy-pesy

   The diff usually looks like this

   #+begin_src diff
   - "@pesy/esy-pesy": "<old version>"
   + "@pesy/esy-pesy": "<new version>"
   #+end_src

   
** pesy

   Same as =@pesy/esy-pesy=
   
   1. =git ls-files | xargs sed -i 's/dev.<num>/alpha.<num/g'=
   2. Commit and push
   3. Tag the commit for just =@pesy/esy-pesy=
   4. =npm publish= (watch the tag)

** Back to dev version for further development

   1. Revert the two commits that bump to release versions
   2. =git ls-files | xargs sed -i 's/dev.<num>/dev.<num + 1>/g'=
   3. Commit and push
