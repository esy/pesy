File name potentially invalid. The OCaml ecosystem's build systems usually turn file names into module names by simply upper-casing the first letter. In this case, `1_bad_file_name_1.ml` starts with `1`, which doesn't form a legal module name.
Note: some build systems might e.g. turn kebab-case into CamelCase module, which is why this isn't a hard error.
