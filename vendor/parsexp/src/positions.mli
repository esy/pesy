(** A [t] value represent a sequence of positions. The focus is on small memory footprint.

    Given a s-expression and a sequence of positions, one can reconstruct the location of
    every sub s-expression. This is used to report location informations without having to
    annotate every node in the s-expression during parsing.

    The s-expression parser saves the positions of each opening and closing parentheses as
    well as the positions of the first and last character of each atom.

    Note that a [t] can hold the same given positions no more than twice. The parser
    stores the same position twice for non-quoted single character atoms.
