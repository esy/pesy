(** Reports an error.

    Because dune doesn't stop at the first error, it might end up
    reporting the same error twice about missing libraries for
    instance. To avoid this, we keep a cache of reported errors and
    ignore errors that have already been reported.

    We cache what is actually printed to the screen.  *)
