(* Artifact substitutions works as follow: the substitution is encoded
   as a string of the form:

   {v %%DUNE_PLACEHOLDER:<len>:<symbolic-value>%% v}

   Where:
   - [<len>] is the full length of the encoded string
   - [<symbolic-value>] is an encoding of a [Value.t]

   For instance:

   "%%DUNE_PLACEHOLDER:46:vcs-describe:7:src/foo%%"

   The placeholder is padded with '%' characters to make it of length
   exactly [<len>].

   The [copy] functions recognises such strings and substitute them
   accordingly. The maximum allowed length of such a string is 65536.

   When the placeholder is substituted, the replacement is encoded as follow:

   "=<len>:<replacement><space-padding>"

   For instance:

   "=3:1.0                                        "

   Replacements that are too long are truncated.

(* Scan a buffer for "%%DUNE_PLACEHOLDER:<len>:" *)
module Scanner = struct
  (* The following module implement a scanner for special placeholders
     strings.  The scanner needs to be fast as possible as it will
     scan every single byte of the input so this module is carefully
     written with performances in mind.

     The logic is implemented as a DFA where each OCaml function
     represent a state of the automaton.

     In the future, we expect to have a C version of the scanner so
     that it can run concurrently with OCaml code in a separate
     thread.  This will speed up the promotion of large binaries from
     the build directory to the source tree.

     {1 Notations}

     In this module, [buf] is the buffer containing the data read from
     the input.  [end_of_data] is the position in [buf] of the end of
     data read from the input.  [pos] is the current reading position
     in [buf].  [placeholder_start] represents the position in [buf]
     where the current potential placeholder starts in [buf].  *)

  (* The following type represents the possible state of the DFA. *)
  type state =
    | Scan0
    (* Initial state and state when we are not in a potential placeholder *)
    | Scan1
    (* State after seeing one '%' *)
    | Scan2
    (* State after seeing at least two '%' *)
    | Scan_prefix of int
    (* [Scan_prefix placeholer_start] is the state after seeing [pos -
       placeholer_start] characters from [prefix] *)
    | Scan_length of int * int
    (* [Scan_length (placeholer_start, acc)] is the state after seeing
       all of [prefix] and the beginning of the length field. [acc] is
       the length accumulated so far. *)
    | Scan_placeholder of int * int
    (* [Scan_placeholder (placeholer_start, len)] is the state after
       seeing all of [prefix] and the length field, i.e. just after
       the second ':' of the placeholder *)

  (* The [run] function at the end of this module is the main function
     that consume a buffer and return the new DFA state.  If the
     beginning of placeholder is found before reaching the end of the
     buffer, [run] immediately returns [Scan_placeholder
     (placeholder_start, len)].

     The following functions represent the transition functions for
     each state of the DFA.  [run] is called only at the beginning and
     immediately chain the execution to the right transition
     function.

     Each transition function is written as follow:

     {[
       let state ~buf ~pos ~end_of_data ... =
         if pos < end_of_data then
           let c = Bytes.unsafe_get buf pos in
           let pos = pos + 1 in
           match c with
           ...
         else
           State (...)
     ]}

     i.e. it either inspect the next character and chain the execution to the
     next transition function or immediately return the DFA state if the end of
     buffer is reached.  Reaching the end of buffer is handled in the [else]
     branch for performance reason: the code generated by OCaml tend to make
     following the [then] branch slightly more efficient and reaching the
     end of buffer is the less likely case.
