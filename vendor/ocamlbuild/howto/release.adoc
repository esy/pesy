= How to release a new OCamlbuild version =

The steps below describe what needs to be done to release a new
OCamlbuild version. The process should be simple and fast, so that we
can release often.

== Preparing the release ==

The steps can be done a few days in advance, and coordinated among
several people. External contributors can do it, and you can use pull
requests to get reviews and feedback.

[[synch-opam-files]]
=== Synchronizing the local and remote opam files ===

One of the last release steps is to <<opam-repo,update the public opam
repository>>, and this will require an 'opam' file describing the
installation-related metadata. There are two sources of inspiration
for these opam files:

- there is a local 'opam' file at the root of the ocamlbuild
  repository, that is used for pinning the development version.

- there are the 'opam' files for previous OCamlbuild releases in the
  public opam repository:
  https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/tree/master/packages/ocamlbuild/

In theory the two should be in synch: the 'opam' file we send to the
public opam repository is derived from the local 'opam' file. However,
upstream opam repository curators may have made changes to the public
opam files, to reflect new packaging best practices and policies. You
should check for any change to the latest version's 'opam' file; if
there is any, it should probably be reproduced into our local 'opam'
file.

Note that the local file may have changed during the release lifetime
to reflect new dependencies or changes in packaging policies. These
changes should be preserved.

You can use +opam lint+ in the package repository to check that the
current opam file satisfies best practices.

=== Changes and annoucement ===

The 'Changes' file at the root of our repository serves as a user- and
contributors-facing memory of the project evolution. The section
concerning the current development version is marked NEXT_RELEASE.

==== Changes entries ====

Check the detailed changelog to make sure that no important feature is
missing, that compatibility-breaking changes are probably marked,
and that existing change entries are descriptive enough.

Changes entries should:

- Describe the change in a way that end-users can understand

- Explicitly say whether it breaks compatibility, and in particular use
  "* " as an entry bullet point in this case.

- Link to the relevant online discussions of the change by giving PR
  or issue numbers when relevant.

- Credit the contributors involved in this change. The name of the
  people that wrote the patch should be included, as well as other
  contributors having made significant non-coding contributions (code
  review, testing, etc.).

[[change-summary]]
==== Release change summary ====

Write a full-text summary of the changes in the release, less detailed
than the full change entries. This text should be a between one
sentence and a couple paragraphs long, and will be included in the
Github description of the release and email announcements.

The release change summary should go in the section of the release,
above the list of change entries.

=== Picking a version number ===

Choose the next version number. You should try to respect
http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning] whenever possible: point
releases should have bugfixes and tweaks only, and minor releases
should not break backward compatibility.

=== Update sources with new version number ===

During development we use +NEXT_RELEASE+ as a placeholder for the next
release number, so any occurence of +NEXT_RELEASE+ in the development
repository should be replaced by this version number. There is at
least one such occurence in the 'Changes' file.

Furthermore, the version coded is hardcoded in some parts of the
codebase and needs to be updated:

- the 'VERSION' file contains the current version number, with no
  ending newline

- the 'META' file contains the current version number to inform ocamlfind

You can use +git grep+ to look for all occurrences of +NEXT_RELEASE+
and a given version number, from the root of the repository:

----
git grep NEXT_RELEASE
git grep -F "0.9"
----

== Doing the release ==

These steps should be performed by someone with push access to the
central git repository.

=== Marking the release day in Changes ===

Mark the current release day in the Changes file.

=== Performing the release through github ===

Github's interface allows to create a release tag and publish
a release. From the https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild[github project
page] you can go to the
https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/releases[release tab] which lists
the current tags and has
a https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/releases/new[draft a new
release] button. Clicking this button (or the latter link in the
previous sentence) will let you pick a tag name, release title, and
description.

The tag name should be just the release version number. See +git
tag --list+ to see existing tags from a command-line. The release name
should be just +Release <version-number>+. The description should be
the Changes section corresponding to the release (release summary and
detailed list of entries).

==== Releasing from the command-line instead ====

If you prefer, you can also perform the same steps using the
command-line:

----
git tag <VERSION> -a
----

This command should start an editor to ask for a tag message. You can
use the <<change-summary,release change summary>> as the tag message.

==== Post-release changes ====

Create an empty Changes section for the next release,

```
NEXT_RELEASE:
-------------
```

Also put NEXT_RELEASE in your VERSION and META file. This will prevent
you from forgetting to update them at the next release time.

== Making the release visible to our users ==

=== push it upstream ===
----
git push
git push --tags
----


[[opam-repo]]
=== opam-repository update ===

You should create a new opam package for the new version. For this,
clone the opam-repository
https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/[upstream repository], go to
https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/tree/master/packages/ocamlbuild/['packages/ocamlbuild']
and create a new repository 'ocamlbuild.<VERSION>'; you need three
files in this repository:

- 'descr', a full-text description of the package: just copy the
  previous version's file.

- 'url', which tells opam how to download an archive; you can copy the
  previous version's file, and you need to update the two fields. It
  looks like this:
+
----
archive: "https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/archive/0.9.0.tar.gz"
checksum: "71c813d51bed39e73937dd4751d593c6"
----
+
The +archive+ is the file built by github at
+https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/archive/<tag-name>.tar.gz+. To
compute the checksum, fetch this file and compute its md5 sum; your
system may have a +md5sum+ command to do this.

- 'opam': this should be just a copy of the 'opam' file at the root of
  the ocamlbuild repository -- which should have been
  <<synch-opam-files,kept in synch>> with upstream packaging
  changes -- with the +version+ field changed from +"dev"+ to the
  current version number.

=== announcing the release ===

You can send an email to the caml-list. The tradition is to use the subject

  [ANN] OCamlbuild <version number>

The mail could be just the release change summary and the detailed
list of change entries. Feel free to add other content according to
your personal preference.
