= Contributing to OCamlbuild

Any contribution is warmly welcome!

Bugs in OCamlbuild itself should be reported on https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/issues[the github bugtracker].
Any OCamlbuild-related question can also be asked on the mailto:caml-list@inria.fr[caml-list mailing-list].

Contributions in the form of patches are most welcome.
We welcome pull requests on the https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pulls[GitHub repository], but you can also email a patch if that is your preference.
OCamlbuild is free software, licensed under the GNU LGPL, and we do our best to review, give feedback, and integrate proposed patches.

In particular, if you try to understand the implementation or documentation, and understanding some part of it requires excessive effort, a patch containing implementation or documentation comments to clarify it to future readers is an excellent idea.

== The OCamlbuild manual

This repository also hosts https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/tree/master/manual/manual.adoc[the OCamlbuild manual].
Feel free to ask questions about unclear part of the manual, or to contribute extra explanations.

The documentation contains a set of https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/tree/master/manual/examples[examples] that anyone can help grow.
If there is a typical kind of setting that you've reused across several projects, is clear and informative, and is not represented in existing examples, feel free to submit it.

You can also help complete the documentation by integrating http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/ocamlbuild/[ocaml.org Wiki] content in the OCamlbuild manual.
This Wiki has a lot of valuable information, but for a mix of social and technical reasons it hasn't evolved into a good alternate documentation that we could point beginners to. We hope this manual can fill this gap.

You can also use https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/issues[our issue tracker] to comment on precise or general shortcomings of the present documentation, such as:

* Things that are missing and must be present;
* Things that are here but should be shortened; or
* Things of which you would like to change the presentation.

A patch is even more useful than a bug report.
For less precise comments (or to send patches), you can send an e-mail to (gabriel dot scherer at gmail).
